# TurtleTalk


We are developing **TurtleTalk**, an AI model trained on Indigenous languages, cultures, and traditions. This model will serve as both a centralized repository for Indigenous knowledge—often scattered across multiple sources—and a user-friendly tool for answering questions on Indigenous topics.

TurtleTalk is built by fine-tuning mBERT on a curated dataset of Indigenous languages, cultures, and traditions. mBERT was chosen for its multilingual capabilities and proven effectiveness in fine-tuning for low-resource languages, making it well-suited for Indigenous language processing.

The dataset is sourced from The Canadian Encyclopedia, Statistics Canada, FirstVoices, Indigenous Services Canada, and the First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC), all of which provide some publicly available data. It can be further expanded with additional sources such as Native Land Digital, the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR), and the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), which also offer varying levels of public data. While the dataset primarily focuses on First Nations, resources from the Métis Nation of Canada and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) provide data on non-First Nations Indigenous communities, some of which is publicly accessible or available upon request
